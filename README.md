- 👋 Hi, I’m @wangada1
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of things such as network security and C++ programming, and I am also an amateur in swimming and badminton.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C and C++ programming and I am new in CS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on CS with anybody who is interested in network security and embeded software development.
- 📫 You can reach me by email me. My email address is wangyang199806@163.com
- Today is a bad day for me because I am so tired and anxious for the negotiation with my professor (also my boss in school).
- I hate to be in the team because The Feeling is so bad and I want to escape.
- But sadly I have to take over the challenge.
